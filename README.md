# CPP index


These projects serve as an introduction to C++ programming, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming and adhering to the C++98 standard. Students are expected to gradually learn new concepts and complexities as they progress through the exercises. No specific coding style is enforced, and the use of the C++ standard library is allowed. However, external libraries such as C++11 or Boost are not permitted, and certain C functions are prohibited. The projects also come with additional requirements, including avoiding memory leaks and following an orthodox canonical form for classes.
